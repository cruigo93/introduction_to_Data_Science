    "\n",
    "Before working with text, one must tokenize it. Tokenization implies splitting the text into units (hence, tokens). Most simply, tokens are just the words. But splitting by word can lose some of the meaning -- \"Santa Barbara\" is one token, not two, but \"rock'n'roll\" should not be split into two tokens. There are ready-to-use tokenizers that take into account peculiarities of the language, but they make mistakes as well, especially when you work with specific sources of text (newspapers, slang, misspellings, typos).\n",
    "\n",
    "After tokenization, you will normalize the data. For text, this is about stemming and/or lemmatization; these are similar processes used to process different forms of a word. One can read about the difference between them [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now that we have turned the document into a sequence of words, we can represent it with vectors. The easiest approach is called Bag of Words: we create a vector with the length of the dictionary, compute the number of occurrences of each word in the text, and place that number of occurrences in the appropriate position in the vector. The process described looks simpler in code:"

    "Adding onto the Bag of Words idea: words that are rarely found in the corpus (in all the documents of this dataset) but are present in this particular document might be more important. Then it makes sense to increase the weight of more domain-specific words to separate them out from common words. This approach is called TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency), which cannot be written in a few lines, so you should look into the details in references such as [this wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf).
